Hello World, my name is Caleb Sedore. I am a senior in the iSchool at Syracuse University with a concentration in information security. Ultimately my career goal is to find a job in the information technology field where I can learn new skills and contribute to a high-level team with opportunity for growth within the organization. I have experience with server grade hardware builds, scripting/coding in python, and two years of direct client support in the ITS Service Center on campus (including a year as a “lead” consultant – a leadership role including advising and directing peers). Before coming to Syracuse, I spent three years as a division one athlete at Lehigh University on the Men’s Basketball Team where I learned the importance of teamwork and relying on each other in complex and intense situations. Communication was a specialty of mine as I spent the first three years of my college career as a journalism major including time writing for the school newspaper. Outside of class and work my interests contain a mix of past experiences and new hobbies – I enjoy playing basketball, Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition, and tinkering/learning about new and exciting technology.
