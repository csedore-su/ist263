            <h1>Smallmouth Bass</h1>
            
        <p>
           <h2>Overview:</h2>
            While on the smaller side of the bass size scale, the Small Mouth Bass packs a punch offering an aggressive and feisty angling experience. Preferring cooler, moving water, Smallmouth are often found in rivers and reservoirs that feature these characteristics. Contrary to the Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth will be found in water with gravel or rocky bottoms.
            
        </p>

           <h2>Characteristics:</h2>
            The Smallmouth Bass entire body has a dark color with vertical lines spotted along the sides of their bodies. The head has dark stripes running from the back to the mouth where their “small mouth” resides. With a preferred habitat of moving water in combination with their “small mouth” the species tends to have a slim and trim but very muscular build leading to at times leading to entertaining and at times, acrobatic, fights.

        </p>

          <h2>How to Catch:</h2>
            Smallmouth bass are very aggressive fish when offered the right type of bait. Like with most fish, live bait such as worms or minnows will produce results but offer a more stationary fishing experience. Lures on the other hand, require less maintenance and offer a consistent experience. Smallmouth bass feed on small minnows, crayfish, grubs, and frogs sampling both surface and subsurface meals.
