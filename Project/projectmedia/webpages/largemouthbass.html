           <strong> Overview:<br></strong>
           The Largemouth Bass is one of the most popular sport fish in North America. Offering a variety of size and thriving in warm, stagnant shallow water these fish are very accessible from the shore or a kayak in the summer months. Aggressive and opportunistic feeders, the Large Mouth Bass offers explosive strikes and a strong fight leading to anglers attempting to lure them out all summer.

           <strong> Characteristics:<br></strong>
           The Largemouth Bass is characterized by an extremely wide mouth allowing them to “gulp” not only passerby but prey on the surface as well. This “large mouth” leads to a wide variety of nicknames with one of the most popular being “bucket mouth”. A medium dark stripe runs down the side of the fish making it easily distinguishable from other species of bass commonly found in Upstate New York waters.

          <strong>  How to Catch:<br></strong>
          There are a variety of ways to catch Largemouth Bass due to their aggressive and opportunistic nature. Traditional baits such as live worms or minnows will draw results but may lead to a more stationary fishing experience. If you have a watercraft of any variety, lures may be your preference, as they allow multiple fish to be caught on one bait.
