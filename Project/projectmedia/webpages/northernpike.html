            <h1>Northern Pike</h1>
            
        <p>
           <h2> Overview:</h2>
           The Northern Pike is found in many regions of the Northern US and much of Canada due to its preference for cooler water temperatures. Growing to 40 plus inches, the Northern Pike is at or near the top of the food chain offering an exhilarating fight for anglers, and providing the opportunity to catch one of the larger freshwater fish in the world. In the summer Northern Pike can often be found near the mouth of tributaries or around deep rocky outcrops where they wait to ambush their prey.

           <h2>Characteristics:</h2>
           The Northern Pike has a slim and sleek body that allows it to fit into many different types of terrain contributing to their predatory ambush style. In the right water temperature, Northern Pike can be world class fishing with back and forth fights that nearly pull the boat, on the contrary in warm water, they tend to be very lethargic and feed only on easy opportunities. Handling and interacting with Pike requires caution as their mouth is lined with razor sharp teeth easily capable of slicing a finger. Although they are at the top of the food chain and offer such potentially harmful features to humans, they are not known to be aggressive to recreating humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h2>  How to Catch:</h2>
          Northern Pike love live bait, worms are acceptable, but minnows and other types of live bait tend to be more effective. There are a wide variety of lures available to target Northern Pike, with many of the common offerings being larger sizes of smaller baits.
